This project is a creative blend of AI and procedural content generation, offering a unique and evolving game world every time you play. Players explore a colorful, randomly generated map filled with treasures, enemies, and mysterious NPCs. What makes this game special is how it reacts to you: using AI-powered sentiment analysis, NPCs adjust their conversations based on the emotions they detect in your responses. Players can choose to be a warrior, mage, ninja, robot, or alien, and embark on an adventure where every decision shapes the experience. With real-time movement, dynamic storytelling, and vibrant visuals, the game creates a lively, personal journey that feels fresh and different each time. Itâ€™s a fun, interactive way to see how artificial intelligence can make games more adaptive, emotional, and alive.
